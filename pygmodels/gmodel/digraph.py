# Directed Graph

This is basically a Graph with directed edges. This has implications on several
algorithms. Most notably connected components algorithm does not work the same
way. The minimum spanning tree also does not work. We need to differentiate the
positioning of nodes in edges as well. Sometimes it is also represented as \f[
G = (V, A) \f] where A is arcs.

Whenever possible we simply change the edge generation strategy in order to use
the parent's algorithm.
